# Radiant-Practice
Radiant practice. I used to use this practice core for a server of mine but then I closed the server and was about to begin selling licenses of it until will decided it needs a recode.

# Please remember this is an open source project which was intended for private use so the code is not the best.

# Rules
*This rules are for if you use or re distribute forks of Radiant*
Must credit on use
Cannot claim as your own must state as a fork
You must DM Vifez on discord to request public usage (re distributing / forking for profits)

# Why I open sourced Radiant?
I decided to open source this practice core because It was too much work to finish it but if we recode it'll be way more efficient and easier, The pracitce core is currenrtly in working state but has a few issues which are stated below.

# Issues & Needs fixing / adding
Spectating
Finish parties (works but just haven't added queues)
Add /duel (queuing works but no duel commnand)
Add ranked (We was in the middle of recoding ranked while we open sourced it)
Fix boxing (Game doesn't finish on 100 hits and the ingame scoreboard doesn't show amount of hits)
Thats all the issues I can remember there is probably a few more.
